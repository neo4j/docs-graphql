:description: This page describes how to use the directives @selectable, @settable, @filterable and `@relationship` to control how fields are exposed.
= Field configuration

In case you need to remove fields from a GraphQL Object Type or a GraphQL Input Object Type, consider the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    age: Int
    actedIn: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}
----

It generates the type `Actor`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  age: Int
  actedIn(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions, directed: Boolean = true): [Movie!]!
  actedInAggregate(where: MovieWhere, directed: Boolean = true): ActorMovieActedInAggregationSelection
  actedInConnection(where: ActorActedInConnectionWhere, first: Int, after: String, directed: Boolean = true, sort: [ActorActedInConnectionSort!]): ActorActedInConnection!
}
----

By using the directives `@selectable`, `@settable`, `@filterable`, and `@relationship` it is possible to control how these fields are exposed.
For instance, to hide the field `age` in the Selection Set, you can use the `@selectable` directive:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    age: Int @selectable(onRead: false, onAggregate: false)
    actedIn: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}
----

Now the type `Actor` looks like this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  actedIn(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions, directed: Boolean = true): [Movie!]!
  actedInAggregate(where: MovieWhere, directed: Boolean = true): ActorMovieActedInAggregationSelection
  actedInConnection(where: ActorActedInConnectionWhere, first: Int, after: String, directed: Boolean = true, sort: [ActorActedInConnectionSort!]): ActorActedInConnection!
}
----

== `@relationship`

There are several nested operations available for every field created using the `@relationship` directive. These are `create`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `connectOrCreate`, and `delete`. 

However, these operations are not always needed. 
The `@relationship` directive allows you to define which operations should be available for a relationship by using the argument `nestedOperations`.

Additionally, the `@relationship` directive causes fields to be added for nested aggregations. 
These can be disabled using the `aggregate` argument.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum NestedOperations {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
    DELETE
    CONNECT
    DISCONNECT
    CONNECT_OR_CREATE
}

directive @relationship(
    type: String!
    queryDirection: RelationshipQueryDirection! = DEFAULT_DIRECTED
    direction: RelationshipDirection!
    properties: String
    nestedOperations: [NestedOperations!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, CONNECT_OR_CREATE]
    aggregate: Boolean! = true
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

[NOTE]
====
In version 4.0.0, `aggregate` is `false` as default.
See xref:migration/v4-migration/index.adoc#_relationship_changes[`@relationship changes`] for more information.
====

=== Usage

*Configure aggregation*

From the previous type definitions, the type `Actor` produced is:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  actedIn(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions, directed: Boolean = true): [Movie!]!
  actedInAggregate(where: MovieWhere, directed: Boolean = true): ActorMovieActedInAggregationSelection
  actedInConnection(where: ActorActedInConnectionWhere, first: Int, after: String, directed: Boolean = true, sort: [ActorActedInConnectionSort!]): ActorActedInConnection!
}
----

Note that the relationship field `actedIn` produces the operation field `actedInAggregate`, which allows aggregations on that relationship. 
It is possible to configure this behavior by passing the argument aggregate on the `@relationship` directive:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    age: Int
    actedIn: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, aggregate: false)
}
----

In this case, as the argument `aggregate` was passed as false, the type `Actor` produced is:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  age: Int
  actedIn(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions, directed: Boolean = true): [Movie!]!
  actedInConnection(where: ActorActedInConnectionWhere, first: Int, after: String, directed: Boolean = true, sort: [ActorActedInConnectionSort!]): ActorActedInConnection!
}
----

*Configure nested operations*

A large part of the schema produced by the library is needed to support nested operations. 
These are enabled by the directive `@relationship` as described in xref:type-definitions/relationships.adoc#_inserting_data[`@relationship` -> Inserting data].

The nested operations available are:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum NestedOperations {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
    DELETE
    CONNECT
    DISCONNECT
    CONNECT_OR_CREATE
}
----

By default, `@relationship` enables all of them when defined. 
To enable only some of them, you have to pass the argument `nestedOperations` specifying the operations required.

*Disable nested create*

To disable the nested `CREATE` operation, change the initial type definitions to:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    age: Int
    actedIn: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, nestedOperations: [UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, CONNECT_OR_CREATE])
}
----

As the `CREATE` operation is not present in the `nestedOperations` argument array, it is no longer possible to create movies starting from the `Actor` type.

*Disable all nested operations*

If instead, no nested operations are required, it is possible to disable all the nested operations by passing an empty array:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    age: Int
    actedIn: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, nestedOperations: [])
}
----

== `@selectable`

This directive sets the availability of fields on queries and aggregations. 
It has two arguments:

* **onRead**: if disabled, this field is not available on queries and subscriptions.
* **onAggregate**: if disabled, aggregations is not available for this field.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate this field for selectable fields."""
directive @selectable(onRead: Boolean! = true, onAggregate: Boolean! = true) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

With the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @selectable(onRead: false, onAggregate: true)
}
----

The type `Movie` in the resulting schema looks like this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
}
----

This means that descriptions cannot be queried, either on top or on nested levels. 
Aggregations, however, are available on both:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type MovieAggregateSelection {
    count: Int!
    description: StringAggregateSelectionNullable!
    title: StringAggregateSelectionNonNullable!
}
----

In case you want to remove the `description` field from `MovieAggregateSelection`, you need to change the `onAggregate` value to `false`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @selectable(onRead: false, onAggregate: false)
}
----

*`@selectable` with relationships*

This directive can be used along with relationship fields. 

From the previous type definitions, the type `Actor` produced is:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  actedIn(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions, directed: Boolean = true): [Movie!]!
  actedInAggregate(where: MovieWhere, directed: Boolean = true): ActorMovieActedInAggregationSelection
  actedInConnection(where: ActorActedInConnectionWhere, first: Int, after: String, directed: Boolean = true, sort: [ActorActedInConnectionSort!]): ActorActedInConnection!
}
----

This means that the `actedIn` field can be queried from the homonymous generated field `actedIn` and the field `actedInConnection`.
To avoid that, it is required to use the directive `@selectable`.
For instance, these type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Movie!]!
        @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
        @selectable(onRead: false, onAggregate: false)
}
----

Generate the type `Actor`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  name: String!
  actedInAggregate(where: MovieWhere, directed: Boolean = true): ActorMovieActedInAggregationSelection
}
----

Note how `actedInAggregate` is not affected by the argument `onAggregate`. 
To disable the generation of `actedInAggregate`, see the `aggregate` argument of the directive xref::/schema-configuration/field-configuration.adoc#_relationship[`@relationship`].

== `@settable`

This directive sets the availability of the input field on creation and update mutations.
It has two arguments:

* **onCreate**: if disabled, this field is not available on creation operations.
* **onUpdate**: if disabled, this field is not available on update operations.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate this input field for mutation."""
directive @settable(onCreate: Boolean! = true, onUpdate: Boolean! = true) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

With this definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @settable(onCreate: true, onUpdate: false)
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Movie!]!
        @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following input fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input MovieCreateInput {
    description: String
    title: String!
}

input MovieUpdateInput {
    title: String
}
----

This means the description can be set on creation, but it is not available on update operations.

*`@settable` with relationships*

This directive can be used along with relationship fields. 
When an operation on a field is disabled this way, that relationship is no longer available on top-level operations. 
For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Movie!]!
        @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
        @settable(onCreate: false, onUpdate: true)
}
----

The following input fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input ActorCreateInput {
  name: String!
}

input ActorUpdateInput {
  name: String
  actedIn: [ActorActedInUpdateFieldInput!]
}
----

This means `actedIn` can be updated on an update, but it is no longer available on `create`` operations.

== `@filterable`

This directive defines the filters generated for the field to which this directive is applied.
It has two arguments:

* **byValue**: if disabled, this field does not generate value filters.
* **byAggregate**: if disabled, this field does not generate aggregation filters.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate filters for this field."""
directive @filterable(byValue: Boolean! = true, byAggregate: Boolean! = true) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

With this definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @filterable(byValue: false, byAggregate: false)
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Movie!]!
        @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following input fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input MovieWhere {
  OR: [MovieWhere!]
  AND: [MovieWhere!]
  NOT: MovieWhere
  title: String
  title_IN: [String!]
  title_CONTAINS: String
  title_STARTS_WITH: String
  title_ENDS_WITH: String
  actorsAggregate: MovieActorsAggregateInput
  actors_ALL: ActorWhere
  actors_NONE: ActorWhere
  actors_SINGLE: ActorWhere
  actors_SOME: ActorWhere
  actorsConnection_ALL: MovieActorsConnectionWhere
  actorsConnection_NONE: MovieActorsConnectionWhere
  actorsConnection_SINGLE: MovieActorsConnectionWhere
  actorsConnection_SOME: MovieActorsConnectionWhere
}

input ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput {
  AND: [ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput!]
  OR: [ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput!]
  NOT: ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_EQUAL: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_EQUAL: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_EQUAL: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_GT: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_GT: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_GT: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_GTE: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_GTE: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_GTE: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_LT: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_LT: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_LT: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_LTE: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_LTE: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_LTE: Int
}
----

As shown by the generated input fields, the `description` field is not available for filtering on both value and aggregation filters.

*`@filterable` with relationships*

This directive can be used along with relationship fields. 
When an operation on a field is disabled this way, that relationship is no longer available on top-level operations. 
For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @filterable(byValue: false, byAggregate: false)
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN) @filterable(byValue: false, byAggregate: false)
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Movie!]!
        @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
        
}
----

The following input fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input MovieWhere {
  OR: [MovieWhere!]
  AND: [MovieWhere!]
  NOT: MovieWhere
  title: String
  title_IN: [String!]
  title_CONTAINS: String
  title_STARTS_WITH: String
  title_ENDS_WITH: String
}

input ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput {
  AND: [ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput!]
  OR: [ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput!]
  NOT: ActorActedInNodeAggregationWhereInput
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_EQUAL: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_EQUAL: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_EQUAL: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_GT: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_GT: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_GT: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_GTE: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_GTE: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_GTE: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_LT: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_LT: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_LT: Int
  title_AVERAGE_LENGTH_LTE: Float
  title_LONGEST_LENGTH_LTE: Int
  title_SHORTEST_LENGTH_LTE: Int
}
----

As shown by the previous inputs fields, the `actors` field is not available for filtering on both value and aggregation filters.

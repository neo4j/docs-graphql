= Indexes and Constraints

This page describes how to use indexes and constraints in the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

== Unique node property constraints

Unique node property constraints map to `@unique` directives used in your type definitions, which has the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a uniqueness constraint in the database for the decorated field."""
directive @unique(
    """The name which should be used for this constraint. By default; type name, followed by an underscore, followed by the field name."""
    constraintName: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

Additionally, the usage of the xref::/directives/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`] directive by default implies that there should be a unique node property constraint in the database for that property.

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these constraints, and you will need to run a function on server startup. 
See the section xref::directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints] for details.

=== `@unique` directive usage

`@unique` directives can only be used in GraphQL object types representing nodes, and they are only applicable for the "main" label for the node.

In the following example, a unique constraint is asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the next example, a unique constraint with name `unique_colour` is asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique(constraintName: "unique_colour")
}
----

The `@node` directive is used to change the database label mapping in this next example, so a unique constraint is asserted for the first label in the list, `Color`, and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(labels: ["Color"]) {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the following example, all labels specified in the `labels` argument of the `@node` directive are also checked when asserting constraints.
If there is a unique constraint specified for the `hexadecimal` property of nodes with the `Hue` label, but not the `Color` label, no error is thrown and no new constraints are created when running `assertIndexesAndConstraints`.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(labels: ["Color", "Hue"]) {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

== Fulltext indexes

You can use the `@fulltext` directive to add a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-full-text-search/[Full text index] inside Neo4j.
For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input FullTextInput {
  indexName: String
  queryName: String
  fields: [String]!
}

"""
Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a fulltext index in the database, allows users to search by the index in the generated schema.
"""
directive @fulltext(indexes: [FullTextInput]!) on OBJECT
----

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these indexes.
You need to run a function on server startup. 
See the section xref::directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints] for details.

=== Specifying the `@fulltext` directive

The `@fulltext` directive can be used on nodes.
In this example, a `Fulltext` index called "ProductName", for the name `field`, on the `Product` node, is added:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
    name: String!
    color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
}
----

When you run xref::directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints], they create the index like so:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex("ProductName", ["Product"], ["name"])
----

=== Using the `@fulltext` directive

For every index specified, a new top level query is generated by the library. 
For example, for the previous type definitions, the following query and types are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    productsFulltextProductName(phrase: String!, where: ProductFulltextWhere, sort: [ProductFulltextSort!],
    limit: Int, offset: Int): [ProductFulltextResult!]!
}

"""The result of a fulltext search on an index of Product"""
type ProductFulltextResult {
  score: Float
  product: Product
}

"""The input for filtering a fulltext query on an index of Product"""
input ProductFulltextWhere {
  score: FloatWhere
  product: ProductWhere
}

"""The input for sorting a fulltext query on an index of Product"""
input ProductFulltextSort {
  score: SortDirection
  product: ProductSort
}

"""The input for filtering the score of a fulltext search"""
input FloatWhere {
  min: Float
  max: Float
}
----

This query can then be used to perform a https://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene full-text query] to match and return products. 
Here is an example of this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  productsFulltextProductName(phrase: "Hot sauce", where: { score: { min: 1.1 } } sort: [{ product: { name: ASC } }]) {
    score
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

This query produces results in the following format:

[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
  "data": {
    "productsFulltextProductName": [
      {
        "score": 2.1265015602111816,
        "product": {
          "name": "Louisiana Fiery Hot Pepper Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "score": 1.2077560424804688,
        "product": {
          "name": "Louisiana Hot Spiced Okra"
        }
      },
      {
        "score": 1.3977186679840088,
        "product": {
          "name": "Northwoods Cranberry Sauce"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Additionally, it is possible to define a custom query name as part of the `@fulltext` directive by using the `queryName` argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ queryName: "CustomProductFulltextQuery", indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
    name: String!
    color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
}
----

This produces the following top-level query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    CustomProductFulltextQuery(phrase: String!, where: ProductFulltextWhere, sort: [ProductFulltextSort!],
    limit: Int, offset: Int): [ProductFulltextResult!]!
}
----

This query can then be used like this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  CustomProductFulltextQuery(phrase: "Hot sauce", sort: [{ score: ASC }]) {
    score
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

== Asserting constraints

In order to ensure that the specified constraints exist in the database, you need to run the function `assertIndexesAndConstraints` (see more details in xref::reference/api-reference/neo4jgraphql.adoc#api-reference-assertconstraints[API reference]).
A simple example to create the necessary constraints might look like the following, assuming a valid driver instance in the variable `driver`. 
This creates two constraints, one for each field decorated with `@id` and `@unique`, and apply the indexes specified in `@fulltext`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Colour {
        id: ID! @id
        hexadecimal: String! @unique
    }

    type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
        name: String!
        color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

await neoSchema.assertIndexesAndConstraints({ options: { create: true }});

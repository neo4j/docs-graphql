This page describes how to use indexes and constraints in the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

[#_fulltext_indexes]
== `@fulltext`

=== Definition

You can use the `@fulltext` directive to add a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-full-text-search/[Full text index] inside Neo4j.
For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input FullTextInput {
  indexName: String
  queryName: String
  fields: [String]!
}

"""
Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a fulltext index in the database, allows users to search by the index in the generated schema.
"""
directive @fulltext(indexes: [FullTextInput]!) on OBJECT
----

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these indexes.
You need to run a function on server startup. 
See the section xref::/directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints] for details.

=== Usage

The `@fulltext` directive can be used on nodes.
In this example, a `Fulltext` index called "ProductName", for the name `field`, on the `Product` node, is added:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
    name: String!
    color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
}
----

When you run xref::/directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints], they create the index like so:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ProductName FOR (n:Product) ON EACH [n.name]
----

For every index specified, a new top level query is generated by the library. 
For example, for the previous type definitions, the following query and types are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    productsFulltextProductName(phrase: String!, where: ProductFulltextWhere, sort: [ProductFulltextSort!],
    limit: Int, offset: Int): [ProductFulltextResult!]!
}

"""The result of a fulltext search on an index of Product"""
type ProductFulltextResult {
  score: Float
  product: Product
}

"""The input for filtering a fulltext query on an index of Product"""
input ProductFulltextWhere {
  score: FloatWhere
  product: ProductWhere
}

"""The input for sorting a fulltext query on an index of Product"""
input ProductFulltextSort {
  score: SortDirection
  product: ProductSort
}

"""The input for filtering the score of a fulltext search"""
input FloatWhere {
  min: Float
  max: Float
}
----

This query can then be used to perform a https://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene full-text query] to match and return products. 
Here is an example of this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  productsFulltextProductName(phrase: "Hot sauce", where: { score: { min: 1.1 } } sort: [{ product: { name: ASC } }]) {
    score
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

This query produces results in the following format:

[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
  "data": {
    "productsFulltextProductName": [
      {
        "score": 2.1265015602111816,
        "product": {
          "name": "Louisiana Fiery Hot Pepper Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "score": 1.2077560424804688,
        "product": {
          "name": "Louisiana Hot Spiced Okra"
        }
      },
      {
        "score": 1.3977186679840088,
        "product": {
          "name": "Northwoods Cranberry Sauce"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Additionally, it is possible to define a custom query name as part of the `@fulltext` directive by using the `queryName` argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ queryName: "CustomProductFulltextQuery", indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
    name: String!
    color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
}
----

This produces the following top-level query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    CustomProductFulltextQuery(phrase: String!, where: ProductFulltextWhere, sort: [ProductFulltextSort!],
    limit: Int, offset: Int): [ProductFulltextResult!]!
}
----

This query can then be used like this:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  CustomProductFulltextQuery(phrase: "Hot sauce", sort: [{ score: ASC }]) {
    score
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

[#_unique_node_property_constraints]
== `@unique`

=== Definition

Unique node property constraints map to `@unique` directives used in your type definitions, which has the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a uniqueness constraint in the database for the decorated field."""
directive @unique(
    """The name which should be used for this constraint. By default; type name, followed by an underscore, followed by the field name."""
    constraintName: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these constraints, and you will need to run a function on server startup. 
See the section xref::/directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#_asserting_constraints[Asserting constraints] for details.

=== Usage

`@unique` directives can only be used in GraphQL object types representing nodes, and they are only applicable for the "main" label for the node.

In the following example, a unique constraint is asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the next example, a unique constraint with name `unique_colour` is asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique(constraintName: "unique_colour")
}
----

The `@node` directive is used to change the database label mapping in this next example, so a unique constraint is asserted for the first label in the list, `Color`, and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(labels: ["Color"]) {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the following example, all labels specified in the `labels` argument of the `@node` directive are also checked when asserting constraints.
If there is a unique constraint specified for the `hexadecimal` property of nodes with the `Hue` label, but not the `Color` label, no error is thrown and no new constraints are created when running `assertIndexesAndConstraints`.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(labels: ["Color", "Hue"]) {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

== Asserting constraints

In order to ensure that the specified constraints exist in the database, you need to run the function `assertIndexesAndConstraints`.
A simple example to create the necessary constraints might look like the following, assuming a valid driver instance in the variable `driver`. 
This creates two constraints, one for each field decorated with `@id` and `@unique`, and apply the indexes specified in `@fulltext`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Color {
        id: ID! @id
        hexadecimal: String! @unique
    }

    type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ indexName: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
        name: String!
        color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

const schema = await neoSchema.getSchema();

await neoSchema.assertIndexesAndConstraints({ options: { create: true }});
----

[#_vector_index_search]
== `@vector`

With the `@vector` GraphQL directive you can query your database to perform a vector index search.
Queries are performed by passing in either a vector index or a query phrase.

A query by vector index finds nodes with a vector embedding similar to that index.
That is, the query performs a nearest neighbor search.

In contrast, a query by phrase (a string of text) forwards the phrase to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI plugin] and the plugin generates a vector embedding for it.
This embedding is then compared to the node vector embeddings in the database.

[NOTE] 
.Prerequisites
==== 
* The database must be Neo4j version 5.15 or higher.
* The node vector embeddings already exist in the database. See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/[Vector indexes] to learn more about vector indexes in Cypher and Neo4j.
* The embeddings must have been created using the same method, that is, the same provider and model. See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/genai/tutorials/embeddings-vector-indexes/[Embeddings & Vector Indexes Tutorial] to learn about vector embeddings in Cypher and Neo4j.
* Queries by vector index cannot be performed across multiple labels.
* Queries by phrase require credentials for the Neo4j GenAI plugin.
====

[NOTE]
====
Vector index searches are _read-only_ in the sense that the data which the queries operate on are retrieved from the database but not altered or written back to the database.
====


=== Definition

[source, graphql]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a vector index in the database, allows users to search by the index in the generated schema."""
directive @vector(indexes: [VectorIndexInput]!) on OBJECT
----

`VectorIndexInput` is defined as follows:

[source, graphql]
----
input VectorIndexInput {
  """(Required) The name of the vector index."""
  indexName: String!
  """(Required) The name of the embedding property on the node."""
  embeddingProperty: String!
  """(Required) The name of the query."""
  queryName: String
  """(Optional) The name of the provider."""
  provider: String
}
----

If the optional field `provider` is set, the type is used for a query by phrase, otherwise for a query by vector.
Allowed values for the `provider` field are defined by the available link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/#ai-providers[GenAI providers].


=== Usage

==== Query by vector index

Perform a nearest neighbor search by passing a vector to find nodes with a vector embedding similar to that vector.

.Type definition
[source, graphql]
----
type Product @vector(indexes: [{
  indexName: "productDescriptionIndex",
  embeddingProperty: "descriptionVector",
  queryName: "searchByDescription"
}]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
}
----

This defines the query to be performed on all `Product` nodes which have a vector index named `productDescriptionIndex` for the property `descriptionVector`, implying that a vector embedding has been created for the `description` property of each node. 

.Example query
[source, graphql]
----
query FindSimilarProducts($vector: [Float]!) {
  searchByDescription(vector: $vector) {
    edges {
      cursor
      score
      node {
          id
          name
          description
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The input `$vector` is a list of `FLOAT` values and should look similar to this:

.An example vector
[source, graphql]
----
{
  "vector": [
    0.123456,
    ...,
    0.654321,
  ]
}
----

The query returns all `Product` nodes with a vector embedding on their `descriptionVector` property which is similar to the query argument `$vector`.

==== Query by phrase

Perform a query which utilizes the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI plugin] to create a vector embedding for a search phrase and then compare it to existing vector embeddings on nodes in the database.

[NOTE]
====
Requires credentials for the plugin.
====

Ensure your provider credentials are set in the call to Neo4jGraphQL, for example:

.Feature configuration
[source, graphql]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        vector: {
            OpenAI: {
                token: "my-open-ai-token",
                model: "text-embedding-3-small",
            },
        },
    },
});
----

`OpenAI` is one of the GenAI providers for generating vector embeddings.
See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/#ai-providers[GenAI providers] for the full list of providers and their respective identifiers.

.Type definition
[source, graphql]
----
type Product @vector(indexes: [{
  indexName: "productDescriptionIndex",
  embeddingProperty: "descriptionVector",
  provider: OPEN_AI,  # Assuming this is configured in the server
  queryName: "searchByPhrase"
}]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
}
----

This defines the query to be performed on all `Product` nodes which have a vector index named `productDescriptionIndex` for the property `descriptionVector`, implying that a vector embedding has been created for the `description` property of each node. 

.Example query
[source, graphql]
----
query SearchProductsByPhrase($phrase: String!) {
  searchByPhrase(phrase: $phrase) {
    edges {
      cursor
      score
      node {
          id
          name
          description
      }
    }
  }
}
----

First, the query passes the query phrase argument `$phrase` to the GenAI plugin and lets it generate a vector embedding for the phrase.
Then it returns all `Product` nodes with a vector embedding on their `descriptionVector` property which are similar to the vector embedding generated by the plugin.

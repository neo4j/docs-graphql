:description: This page describes the functionalities of the Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox.

The https://graphql-toolbox.neo4j.io[Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox] is an onboarding, low-code tool that can be integrated to Neo4j.
It was created for development and experimentation with Neo4j GraphQL APIs.
With it, you can:

. Connect to a Neo4j database with valid credentials.
. Define (or introspect) the type definitions.
. Build the Neo4j GraphQL schema.
. Experiment, query, and play.

== Connect to a Neo4j database

Before you start using the Toolbox, make sure you have followed all xref:index.adoc#_requirements[requirements] to run a Neo4j database.
You can use https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/[Neo4j Desktop] or https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/[Neo4j AuraDB] for that.

== Set the type definitions

. Set your type definitions directly in the Toolbox editor or introspect the Neo4j database you connected to.
+
If you followed the xref:getting-started/index.adoc[Getting started tutorial], you should see  the following type definitions in GraphQL Toolbox:
+
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
  actedInMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
  name: String!
}

type Movie {
  actorsActedIn: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
  title: String!
}
----

. Click the button "Build schema" and then go to the Query editor tab. 

. Query the Neo4j database using the autogenerated GraphQL queries and mutations from the `@neo4j/graphql` library:
+
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  actors {
    name
  }
}
----
+

The query returns the name of the single actor in the database:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{ "data": { "actors": [{ "name": "Tom Hanks" }] } }
----

== Store type definitions as favorite

You can store your type definitions as favorites and access a range of settings to work with.

. Go to the Type definitions tab and click on the star icon to save it as a favorite:

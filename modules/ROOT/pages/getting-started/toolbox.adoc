= Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox

The https://graphql-toolbox.neo4j.io[Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox] is an onboarding, low-code tool that can be integrated to Neo4j.
It was created for development and experimentation with Neo4j GraphQL APIs.
With it, you can:

. Connect to a Neo4j database with valid credentials.
. Define (or introspect) the type definitions.
. Build the Neo4j GraphQL schema.
. Experiment, query, and play.

== Connect to a Neo4j database

Before start using the Toolbox, make sure you have followed all xref:index.adoc#requirements[requirements] to run a Neo4j database.
You can use https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/[Neo4j Desktop] or https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/[Neo4j AuraDB] for that.

== Set the type definitions

. Set your type definitions directly in the Toolbox editor or introspect the Neo4j database you connected to.

If you followed the xref:getting-started/index.adoc[Getting started tutorial], you should see something like this:

:description: This section describes how to get started with the Neo4j GraphQL Library.


This tutorial walks you through creating a new project with the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

If you are not familiar with Neo4j and GraphQL, you can alternatively take the course https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/graphql-basics/?ref=docs[Introduction to Neo4j & GraphQL] in GraphAcademy to learn the fundamentals, how to use the xref:getting-started/toolbox.adoc[Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox] and the Neo4j GraphQL Library to create GraphQL APIs backed by a Neo4j graph database.

This tutorial shows you how to:

- Install the Neo4j GraphQL Library and its dependencies.
- Set type definitions that represent the structure of your graph database.
- Start an instance of the library to generate a GraphQL schema.
- Run an instance of a server to execute queries and mutations against your schema.

The tutorial assumes familiarity with command line and JavaScript, and also that you have a recent version of Node.js installed. 
The examples use the default `npm` package manager, but you can use another one of choice.

== Create a new project

. Create a new directory and `cd` into it:
+
[source, bash, indent=0]
----
mkdir neo4j-graphql-example
cd neo4j-graphql-example
----
+
. Create a new Node.js project (with ESM modules enabled by using the es6 option):
+
[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm init es6 --yes
----
+
. Create an empty `index.js` file which will contain all of the code for this tutorial:
+
[source, bash, indent=0]
----
touch index.js
----

== Install dependencies

. Install the Neo4j GraphQL Library and its dependencies:
+
.. `@neo4j/graphql`: the official Neo4j GraphQL Library package.
It takes your GraphQL type definitions and generates a schema backed by a Neo4j database.
.. `graphql`: the package used to generate a schema and execute queries and mutations.
.. `neo4j-driver`: the official Neo4j Driver package for JavaScript, of which an instance must be passed into the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

. Install a GraphQL server package to host your schema and allow the execution of queries and mutations against it.
.. The https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/[`@apollo/server`] is the default package for Apollo Server:
+
[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm install @neo4j/graphql graphql neo4j-driver @apollo/server
----

. Set up a https://neo4j.com[Neo4j database].
Make sure it fulfills the xref::index.adoc#_requirements[requirements], including the necessary plugins.

== Set GraphQL type definitions

The Neo4j GraphQL Library is primarily driven by type definitions which map to the nodes and relationships in your Neo4j database. 
To get started, use a simple example with two node types, one with label "Actor" and the other "Movie":

. Open the previously created `index.js` in your editor of choice and write your type definitions. 
Add all of the necessary package imports:
+
[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Movie {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;
----
+
Note that these type definitions only *define* the node labels "Actor" and "Movie", and a relationship "ACTED_IN" between the two. 
When the schema is generated, you can then execute queries for `actors` and `movies` to read data from the database.

. Alternatively, you can also automatically generate type definitions from an existing database by xref::introspector.adoc[introspecting the schema].

== Create an instance of `Neo4jGraphQL`

To create an instance of the Neo4j GraphQL Library, you need a Neo4j driver to connect to your database.

=== Using AuraDB

. For an AuraDB database, https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/?ref=docs-graphql[create an instance].

. Make sure to save the generated password and the connection URI provided after the instance is ready and looking similar to this:
+
image::neo4j-aura-dashboard.png[width=500]

=== Using a Neo4j database

For a database located at the default "neo4j://localhost:7687" (see more about https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/ports[port configuration]), with the username "username" and the password "password", add the following to the bottom of your `index.js` file:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
----

== Create an instance of `ApolloServer`

To create an Apollo Server instance using the generated schema, in which you can execute queries against it, add the following to the bottom of `index.js`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
----

== Start the server


Make sure that your `index.js` file looks like this:

[source, javascript]
----
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Movie {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    context: async ({ req }) => ({ req }),
    listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
----

You are ready to start up your GraphQL server. 
Back in the command line, run:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
node index.js
----

If successful, you should see the following output:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
----

The address http://localhost:4000/ is the URL where the Apollo Server starts.


== Create nodes in the database

. Visit http://localhost:4000/ in your web browser. 
You should get redirected to the Apollo Sandbox:
+
image::apollo-server-landing-page.png[]

. At the moment your database is empty. 
To start adding data, copy and paste the following mutation to the Operation panel to create a movie and an actor in that movie:
+
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  createMovies(
    input: [
      {
        title: "Forrest Gump"
        actors: { create: [{ node: { name: "Tom Hanks" } }] }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    movies {
      title
      actors {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
----

. Click the "Run" button on the top right. 
You should get the following confirmation that the data has been created in the database in the Response panel:
+
[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
  "data": {
    "createMovies": {
      "movies": [
        {
          "title": "Forrest Gump",
          "actors": [
            {
              "name": "Tom Hanks"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

. Query the data which you just added. 
Copy and paste the following query to the Operations panel:
+
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  movies {
    title
    actors {
      name
    }
  }
}
----
+
Since you only created one "Movie" node and one "Actor", the Response panel shows the following:
+
[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
  "data": {
    "movies": [
      {
        "title": "Forrest Gump",
        "actors": [
          {
            "name": "Tom Hanks"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial.
By now, you should have a GraphQL API connected to a Neo4j database, to which you added two nodes.

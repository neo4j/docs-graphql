= Migration to 5.0.0

This page lists all breaking changes from the Neo4j GraphQL Library version 4.x to 5.x and how to update it.

== How to update

To update your Neo4j GraphQL Library, use npm or the package manager of choice:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm update @neo4j/graphql
----

== Breaking changes

Here is a list of all the breaking changes from version 4.0.0 to 5.0.0.

=== `@relationshipProperties`

The directive `@relationshipProperties` should now be used on types rather than interfaces.
For example:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Before | Now

a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    screenTime: Int
}

type Movie {
    title: String
    actors: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
}

type Person {
    name: String
}
----
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    screenTime: Int
}

type Movie {
    title: String
    actors: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
}

type Person {
    name: String
}
----
|===

=== Interface directives

To better match the default behavior of GraphQL, library directives used in interfaces will not cascade to the implementing types anymore. 
This means that most directives are no longer valid in interfaces and have to be defined in the implementing types. 
This also applies to custom directives.



=== `@declareRelationship`

The `@relationship` directive is no longer available in interfaces. 
If you need a relationship to be available on interfaces, you need to use the new `@declareRelationship` directive instead, as well as define the relationships in the concrete type.

This change is due to directives no longer cascading from interfaces to types.
However, now it is possible for a relationship to have different properties and labels in each type.
For example:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Before | Now
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Movie implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]!
}

type Series implements Production {
    title: String!
    episodes: Int!
    actors: [Actor!]! 
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
}
----
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @declareRelationship
}

type Movie implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Series implements Production {
    title: String!
    episodes: Int!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
}
----
|===


=== Edge properties

Edge properties in connections now exist within the field `properties` in `edges`:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Before | Now
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query ActedInConnection {
  actors {
    actedInConnection {
      edges {
          screenTime
      }
    }
  }
}
----
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query ActedInConnection {
  actors {
    actedInConnection {
      edges {
        properties {
          screenTime
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
|===


=== `_on` filters deprecated

`_on` filters for interfaces are no longer available in `where` and mutations. To filter by an implementing type, you need to use the new filter `typename_IN`: 


[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Before | Now
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query MyQuery {
  actors(
    where: {
      actedInConnection_SINGLE: { node: { _on: { Movie: { } } } }
    }
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----
a|
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query MyQuery {
 actors(
    where: {
      actedInConnection_SINGLE: { node: { typename_IN: [Movie] } }
    }
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----
|===


[NOTE]
====
Using fields of a type in an interface operation is no longer supported.
====

==== Minimum NodeJS version

With the deprecation of Node 16, the minimum supported NodeJS version is `18.0.0`.

==== `experimental` flag

The `experimental` flag is no longer available in the options of the `Neo4jGraphQL` class.

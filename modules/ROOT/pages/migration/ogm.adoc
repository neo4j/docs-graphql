This page describes what updates were made to the OGM tool in version 4.0.0 of the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

== Database specification

The method to specify the database that the OGM should use has been changed.
This was previously configured using the `driverConfig` option:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { OGM } from "@neo4j/graphql-ogm";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type User {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const ogm = new OGM({ typeDefs, driver, driverConfig: { database: "some-other-database" } });
----

And now it has been raised to the top-level:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { OGM } from "@neo4j/graphql-ogm";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type User {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const ogm = new OGM({ typeDefs, driver, database: "some-other-database" });

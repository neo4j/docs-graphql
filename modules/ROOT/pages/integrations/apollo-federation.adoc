This guide shows how to create a subgraph using the Neo4j GraphQL Library, for composition into a supergraph using Apollo Federation. 

The objective is to convert the following monolithic schema into a subgraph schema for use behind a Federation gateway:

[source, javascript]
----
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server/standalone";
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`;

const {
  NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687/neo4j",
  NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j",
  NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password",
} = process.env;

const driver = neo4j.driver(NEO4J_URI, neo4j.auth.basic(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD));

const neo4jgraphql = new Neo4jGraphQL({
  typeDefs,
  driver,
})

const schema = await neo4jGraphQL.getSchema();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
----

== Setup

To proceed with the convertion, follow these steps:

. Create a directory for a new project and `cd` into it:
+
[source, bash]
----
mkdir neo4j-graphql-subgraph-example
cd neo4j-graphql-subgraph-example
----

. Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm`:
+
[source, bash]
----
npm init --yes
npm pkg set type="module"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This how-to guide sets up the project using ES Modules, which allows the usage of features such as top-level `await`.
====

. Choose TypeScript or JavaScript to proceed with the setup:
+
[.tabbed-example]
====

[.include-with-Typescript]
====
. Create a `src` directory with an empty `index.ts` file to contain the entrypoint to your code:
+
[source, bash]
----
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
----
+
. Install the development dependencies required for working with a TypeScript project:
+
[source, bash]
----
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @tsconfig/node-lts
----
+
. Create an empty `tsconfig.json` file containing the compiler configuration for TypeScript:
+
[source, bash]
----
touch tsconfig.json
----
+
. Add the following configuration to the `tsconfig.json` file:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/node-lts/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "dist",
  }
}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This configuration extends the https://github.com/tsconfig/bases#node-lts-tsconfigjson[community base for Node.js LTS], provided by the `@tsconfig/node-lts` package installed above. 
For more information on the available options, see the https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig[TypeScript Compiler docs].
====
+
. Replace the default `scripts` entry in your `package.json` file with the following:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  // ...etc.
  "scripts": {
    "compile": "tsc",
    "start": "npm run compile && node ./dist/index.js"
  }
  // other dependencies
}
----
====

[.include-with-JavaScript]
====
. Create a `src` directory with an empty `index.js` file to contain the entrypoint to your code:
+
[source, bash]
----
mkdir src
touch src/index.js
----
+
. Replace the default `scripts` entry in your `package.json` file with the following:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  // ...etc.
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
  // other dependencies
}
----
====
====
+
. This guide requires the installation of the following dependencies:
+
* `@apollo/server`, the library for Apollo Server, is used in this guide to host the subgraph.
* `@neo4j/graphql` is the Neo4j GraphQL Library, which translates GraphQL into Cypher and returns the results.
* `graphql` is the reference implementation of the GraphQL specification. It is required for `@neo4j/graphql` to function.
* `neo4j-driver` is the library for the Neo4j driver, which is required to execute Cypher queries against the database.

+

Install them by running this command:

[source, bash]
----
npm install @apollo/server @neo4j/graphql graphql neo4j-driver
----

== Opt in to Federation

For a set of type definitions to be usable as a subgraph for Federation, they must include the following schema extension:

[source, javascript]
----
const typeDefs = `#graphql
  extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key"])

  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`;
----

[NOTE]
====
This example only includes the Federation `@key` directive. 
To use more https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives[Federation directives], add them to the `import` array.
====

== Define an entity

Defining a type as an https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/[entity] allows other subgraphs to contribute with fields to the `Movie` type.
To achieve that, use the `@key` directive to designate a field (or fields) as a key:

[source, javascript]
----
const typeDefs = `#graphql
  extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key"])

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`;
----

Although only the `@key` directive has been added to this example, consider using either the `@id` or the `@unique` directives on the `id` field.
The Federation gateway expects each key to resolve to one result, so it is good practice to ensure that these values are unique in the database.

== Generate a subgraph schema

When using the Neo4j GraphQL Library, generating the subgraph schema can be achieved by calling `getSubgraphSchema` instead of `getSchema`.
For that, the following line needs to be changed:

[source, javascript]
----
const schema = neo4jgraphql.getSubgraphSchema();
----

== Conclusion

By combining all previous snippets, you should get this:

[source, javascript]
----
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server/standalone";
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`;

const {
  NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687/neo4j",
  NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j",
  NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password",
} = process.env;

const driver = neo4j.driver(NEO4J_URI, neo4j.auth.basic(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD));

const neo4jgraphql = new Neo4jGraphQL({
  typeDefs,
  driver,
})

const schema = await neo4jGraphQL.getSubgraphSchema();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
----

For further iteration, this subgraph can also be composed into a supergraph.

= Relay Compatibility

The https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification/[Relay GraphQL Server Specification] states that in order for a server to be compatible with Relay, it must provide:

. A mechanism for refetching an object.
. A description of how to page through connections.

The Neo4j GraphQL Library provides a description of how to page through connections out of the box.
However, configuration is required for it to provide a mechanism for refetching an object, which this page details.

== Object identification

In order for a Relay client to be able to refetch objects, each type must have a unique object identifier which can be used for this purpose.
A server then informs a Relay client that this requirement has been satisfied by having types that implement the `Node` directive, which has the following definition:

[source, graphql]
----
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}
----

So for example, a type `Book` might have the definition:

[source, graphql]
----
type Book implements Node {
  id: ID!
  isbn: String!
}
----

With that, Relay clients are able to refetch `Book` objects using the `node` query field.
The following section dives into how to do this with the Neo4j GraphQL Library.


== `@relayId`

The Neo4j GraphQL Library provides an abstraction over the required `id` field, allowing the value of any unique property in the database to be used as the object identifier.
This is provided by the `@relayId` directive

=== Definition

The `@relayId` directive has the following definition:

[source, graphql]
----
directive @relayId on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

For books, the ISBN usually is a unique identifier:

[source, graphql]
----
type Book {
  isbn: String! @relayId
}
----

When the schema is augmented, this type is output as:

[source, graphql]
----
type Book implements Node {
  id: ID!
  isbn: String!
}
----

When the `id` field is used, `isbn` is the underlying property that is used in the database.
Also, the `Book` type is now refetchable via the `node` query field, and is ready to be used with a Relay client.

[WARNING]
====
The `@relayId` directive does not guarantee uniqueness.
You should configure a unique node property constraint using xref:directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc[the `@unique` directive].

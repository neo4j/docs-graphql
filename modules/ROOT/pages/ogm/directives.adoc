This page describes how to use directives in OGM and which ones were excluded.

== `@private`

The `@private` directive allows specifying what fields should only be accessible through the OGM. 
This is a useful feature when in need of hiding fields such as passwords, for example.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to only expose a field through the Neo4j GraphQL OGM."""
directive @private on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

Given the following type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    username: String!
    email: String!
    password: String! @private
}
----

In your application, you may want to hash passwords and hide them from public viewing. 
This can be done with a custom resolver, using the OGM, to update and set passwords.

Such a scenario gets more apparent when you want to use the same type definitions to drive a public-facing schema and an OGM.
For example:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import { OGM } from "@neo4j/graphql-ogm";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password")
);

const typeDefs = `
    type User {
        username: String!
        email: String!
        password: String! @private
    }
`;

// public without password
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

// private with access to password
const ogm = new OGM({ typeDefs, driver });

Promise.all([neoSchema.getSchema(), ogm.init()]).then(([schema]) => {
    const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({ schema });
})
----

== Excluded directives

The following directives are excluded from the OGM's schema:

- `@authentication`
- `@authorization`
- `@subscriptionsAuthorization`
- `@query`
- `@mutation`
- `@subscription`
- `@filterable`
- `@selectable`
- `@settable`

The reason is that the OGM is only ever used programmatically, as opposed to an exposed API which needs these security measures.
See the page on xref:type-definitions/directives/index.adoc[Neo4j GraphQL directives] for more information.

== Spatial Types

Neo4j GraphQL spatial types translate to spatial values stored using https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/[`Point`] in the database. 
The use of either of these types in a GraphQL schema automatically introduces the types needed to run queries and mutations relevant to these spatial types.

=== `Point`

The `Point` type is used to describe the two https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/#spatial-values-crs-geographic[Geographic coordinate reference systems] supported by Neo4j.

In order to use it in your schema, you quite simply add a field with a type `Point` to any type or types in schema, like the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type TypeWithPoint {
    location: Point!
}
----

Once this has been done, the `Point` type is automatically added to your schema, in addition to all of the input and output types you need to query and manipulate spatial types through your API.

These are the automatically generated types and how to use them:

==== Type definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Point {
    latitude: Float!
    longitude: Float!
    height: Float
}
----

==== Queries and mutations

Due to the fact that `Point` is an object type, it has an additional type for input in queries and mutations. 
However, this input type has the same shape as the object type:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input PointInput {
    latitude: Float!
    longitude: Float!
    height: Float
}
----

For example, you can query for a `User` with an exact location:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query Users($longitude: Float!, $latitude: Float!) {
    users(where: { location: { longitude: $longitude, latitude: $latitude } }) {
        name
        location {
            longitude
            latitude
        }
    }
}
----

Or you can create a `User` with a location as follows:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateUsers($name: String!, $longitude: Float!, $latitude: Float!) {
    createUsers(input: [{ name: $name, location: { longitude: $longitude, latitude: $latitude } }]) {
        users {
            name
            location {
                longitude
                latitude
            }
        }
    }
}
----

==== Filtering

Besides the xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc#filtering-numerical-operators[Numerical operators], the `Point` type has an additional `_DISTANCE` filter.
Here is a list of what each filter does:

* `_LT`: checks that the specified `Point` field is less than the `distance` away in meters from the `Point` being compared against.
* `_LTE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is less than or equal to the `distance` away in meters from the `Point` being compared against.
* `_DISTANCE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is the exact `distance` away in meters from the `Point` being compared against.
* `_GTE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is greater than the `distance` away in meters from the `Point` being compared against.
* `_GT`: checks that the specified `Point` field is greater than or equal to the `distance` away in meters from the `Point` being compared against.

All of the filters take the following type as an argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input PointDistance {
    point: Point!
    distance: Float!
}
----

In practice, you can construct queries such as the following which can find all users within a 5km (5000m) radius of a `Point`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query CloseByUsers($longitude: Float!, $latitude: Float!) {
    users(where: { location_LTE: { point: { longitude: $longitude, latitude: $latitude }, distance: 5000 } }) {
        name
        location {
            longitude
            latitude
        }
    }
}
----

=== `CartesianPoint`

The `CartesianPoint` type is used to describe the two https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/#spatial-values-crs-cartesian[Cartesian coordinate reference systems] supported by Neo4j.

To use it in the schema, add a field with a type `CartesianPoint` to any type or types, such as in this example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type TypeWithCartesianPoint {
    location: CartesianPoint!
}
----

Once this has been done, the `CartesianPoint` type is automatically added to your schema, in addition to all of the input and output types you will need to query and manipulate spatial types through your API.

These are the automatically generated types and how to use them:

==== Type definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type CartesianPoint {
    x: Float!
    y: Float!
    z: Float
}
----

==== Queries and mutations

Due to the fact that `CartesianPoint` is an object type, it has an additional type for input in queries and mutations.
However, this input type has the same shape as the object type:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input CartesianPointInput {
    x: Float!
    y: Float!
    z: Float
}
----

==== Filtering

Besides the xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc#filtering-numerical-operators[Numerical operators], the `CartesianPoint` type has an additional `_DISTANCE` filter. 

Here is a list of what each filter does:

* `_LT`: checks that the specified `Point` field is less than the `distance` away from the `CartesianPoint` being compared against, in the units used to specify the points.
* `_LTE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is less than or equal to the `distance` away from the `CartesianPoint` being compared against, in the units used to specify the points.
* `_DISTANCE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is the exact `distance` away from the `CartesianPoint` being compared against, in the units used to specify the points.
* `_GTE`: checks that the specified `Point` field is greater than the `distance` away from the `CartesianPoint` being compared against, in the units used to specify the points.
* `_GT`: checks that the specified `Point` field is greater than or equal to the `distance` away from the `CartesianPoint` being compared against, in the units used to specify the points.

All of the filters take the following type as an argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input CartesianPointDistance {
    point: CartesianPoint!
    distance: Float!
}
----

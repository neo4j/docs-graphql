This page describes how to use directives for database mapping.

[[type-definitions-alias]]
== `@alias`

This directive maps a GraphQL field to a Neo4j property on a node or relationship.
It can be used on any fields that are not `@cypher` or `@relationship` fields.

For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id @alias(property: "dbId")
    username: String!
}
----

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id
    username: String! @alias(property: "dbUserName")
    livesIn: [City!]! @relationship(direction: OUT, type: "LIVES_IN", properties: "UserLivesInProperties")
}

type City {
    name: String
}

interface UserLivesInProperties @relationshipProperties {
    since: DateTime @alias(property: "moveInDate")
}
----

Note that the property in aliases are automatically escaped (wrapped with backticks ``), so there is no need to add escape characters around them.

[[type-definitions-plural]]
== `@plural`

This directive redefines how to compose the plural of the type for the generated operations.
This is particularly useful for types that are not correctly pluralized or are non-English words.
Take this type definition as an example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Tech @plural(value: "Techs") {
  name: String
}
----

This way, instead of the wrongly generated `teches`, the type is properly written as `techs`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  techs {
    title
  }
}
----

The same is applied to other operations such as `createTechs`. 
However, keep in mind that database labels are not changed with this directive.

[[type-definitions-node]]
== `@node`

This directive is used to specify the configuration of a GraphQL object type which represents a Neo4j node.
It can be appended with the following optional parameters:

[discrete]
=== `labels`

This parameter defines the list of label to be used in Neo4j instead of the GraphQL type name:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Dog @node(labels: ["K9"]) {
    name: String!
}
----

This way, the following query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  dogs {
    name
  }
}
----

Generates the Cypher query:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (this: K9)
RETURN this { .name } as name
----

If the GraphQL type name should still be used as a label, it needs to be specified as well:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Dog @node(labels: ["Dog", "K9"]) {
    name: String!
}
----

This way, the following query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  dogs {
    name
  }
}
----

Generates the Cypher query:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (this:Dog:K9)
RETURN this { .name } as this
----

[NOTE]
====
Defining `labels` means you take control of the database labels of the node. 
Indexes and constraints in Neo4j only support a single label, for which the first element of the `labels` argument is used.
====

The following example results in a unique constraint to be asserted for the label `K9` and the property `name`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Dog @node(labels: ["K9", "Dog"]) {
    name: String! @unique
}
----

=== Using `$jwt` and `$context`

In some cases, you may want to generate dynamic labels depending on the user requesting. 
For that, you can use the variable `$jwt` to define a custom label in the JWT:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @node(labels: ["$jwt.username"]) {
    name: String!
}
----

The following query yields a different Cypher query depending on the user JWT:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  users {
    name
  }
}
----

Assuming there is a user with the value `"username": "arthur"` in JWT, the Cypher query looks like:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (this:arthur)
RETURN this { .name } as this
----

Similarly, context values can be passed directly:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @node(label: ["$context.appId"]) {
    name: String!
}
----

When running the server with Apollo:

[source, js, indent=0]
----
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    context: async ({ req }) => ({ req, appId: "myApp" }),
});
----

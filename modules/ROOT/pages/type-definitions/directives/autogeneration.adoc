= Autogeneration

This page describes directives used for autogeneration:

[[type-definitions-autogeneration-id]]
== `@id`

This directive marks a field as an identifier for an object type.
This enables autogeneration of IDs for the field.

The format of each generated ID is a UUID generated by https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-randomuuid[randomUUID() function].
The field will not be present in input types for mutations.

It is recommended to use xref::/type-definitions/directives/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#type-definitions-constraints-unique[`@unique`] in conjunction with this to add a unique node property constraint.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Indicates that the field is an identifier for the object type."""
directive @id on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

The following type definition specifies the `id` field as an autogenerated value:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id
    username: String!
}
----

[[type-definitions-autogeneration-timestamp]]
== `@timestamp`

This directive marks a field as a timestamp field, which can be used to store timestamps of when particular events happen through the GraphQL API.

[NOTE]
====
These events are triggered and stored at the GraphQL API layer. 
Events happening in your database through other routes do not trigger updates of these timestamps.
====

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum TimestampOperation {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate timestamps on particular events, which will be available as the value of the specified field."""
directive @timestamp(
    """Which events to generate timestamps on. Defaults to both create and update."""
    operations: [TimestampOperation!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

The following type definition has two individual fields to store the timestamps of create and update events:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    createdAt: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [CREATE])
    updatedAt: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [UPDATE])
}
----

The following two equivalent type definitions have a single field storing the event timestamp of the last `create` or `update`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    lastModified: DateTime! @timestamp
}
----

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    lastModified: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [CREATE, UPDATE])
}
----

[[type-definitions-autogeneration-populated-by]]
== `@populatedBy`

This directive is used to specify a callback function that gets executed during GraphQL query parsing,
to populate fields which have not been provided within the input.

For non-required values, callbacks may return `undefined` (meaning that nothing is changed or added to the property) or `null` (meaning that the property will be removed).

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum PopulatedByOperation {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to invoke the specified callback function to populate the field when updating or creating the properties on a node or relationship."""
directive @populatedBy(
    """The name of the callback function."""
    callback: String!
    """Which events to invoke the callback on."""
    operations: [PopulatedByOperation!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

Type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product {
    name: String!
    slug: String! @populatedBy(callback: "slug", operations: [CREATE, UPDATE])
}
----

Schema construction (note that the callback is asynchronous):

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const slugCallback = async (root) => {
    return `${root.name}_slug`
}

new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: { 
        populatedBy: {
            callbacks: {
                slug: slugCallback
            } 
        }
    }
})
----

== Context values

The GraphQL context for the request is available as the third argument in a callback. 
This maps to the argument pattern for GraphQL resolvers.

For example, if you want a field `modifiedBy`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Record {
    content: String!
    modifiedBy: @populatedBy(callback: "modifiedBy", operations: [CREATE, UPDATE])
}
----

If the username is located in `context.username`, you could define a callback such as:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const modifiedByCallback = async (_parent, _args, context) => {
    return context.username;
}

new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: { 
        populatedBy: {
            callbacks: {
                modifiedBy: modifiedByCallback
            } 
        }
    }
})
----

Note that the second positional argument, in this case `_args`, has a type of `Record<string, never>`, and as such it will always be an empty object.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum CallbackOperation {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to invoke the specified callback function when updating or creating the properties on a node or relationship."""
directive @callback(
    """Which events to invoke the callback on."""
    operations: [CallbackOperation!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE]
    """The name of the callback function."""
    name: String!
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

Type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product {
    name: String!
    slug: String! @callback(operations: [CREATE, UPDATE], name: "slug")
}
----

Schema construction (note that the callback is asynchronous):

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const slugCallback = async (root) => {
    return `${root.name}_slug`
}

new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        populatedBy: {
            callbacks: {
                slug: slugCallback
            } 
        }
    }
})

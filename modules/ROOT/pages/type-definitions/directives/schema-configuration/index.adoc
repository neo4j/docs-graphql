:description: This section describes configurations that can be set to a schema in Neo4j GraphQL.


Neo4j GraphQL Library supports several functionalities such as CRUD operations, aggregation, filtering, and others.
To make them work, a large amount of GraphQL types are generated.
However, in some cases, it may be advisable to reduce the scope of the API produced.

This section provides information on how to limit access to unwanted operations and reduce the size of the schema which can improve the performance:

- xref::schema-configuration/type-configuration.adoc[Type configuration] - How to set up query, mutation, and subscription types.
- xref::schema-configuration/global-configuration.adoc[Global configuration] - How to globally disable specific types of operation.
- xref::schema-configuration/field-configuration.adoc[Field configuration] - How to remove fields from a GraphQL Object Type or a GraphQL Input Object Type.

:description: This page describes how to use unions on relatinship fields with the Neo4j GraphQL Library.
= Union types

The Neo4j GraphQL Library supports the use of unions on relationship fields. 

As an example, consider the following schema.
It defines a `User` type that has a relationship `HAS_CONTENT`, of type `[Content!]!`. 
`Content` is of type `union`, representing either a `Blog` or a `Post`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
union Content = Blog | Post

type Blog {
    title: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}

type Post {
    content: String
}

type User {
    name: String
    content: [Content!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_CONTENT", direction: OUT)
}
----

== Creating a union

To create the union featured in the example, you need to do this mutation:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateUserAndContent {
    createUsers(
        input: [
            {
                name: "Dan"
                content: {
                    Blog: {
                        create: [
                            {
                                node: {
                                    title: "My Cool Blog"
                                    posts: {
                                        create: [
                                            {
                                                node: {
                                                    content: "My Cool Post"
                                                }
                                            }
                                        ]
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    ) {
        users {
            name
        }
    }
}
----

== Querying a union

Which union members are returned by a query are dictated by the `where` filter applied to the query.
The following example returns all user content, more specifically the title of each blog:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query GetUsersWithBlogs {
    users {
        name
        content {
            ... on Blog {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

While this particular query only returns blogs, you could for instance use a filter to check that the title is not null when the list of blogs is returned:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query GetUsersWithAllContent {
    users {
        name
        content(where: { Blog: { NOT: { title: null } }}) {
            ... on Blog {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This also helps with preventing overfetching.

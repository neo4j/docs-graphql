= Configuration

== Instantiation

The Neo4j GraphQL Library can accept JSON Web Tokens via two mechanisms:

* Encoded JWTs in the `token` field of the request context.
* Decoded JWTs in the `jwt` field of the request context.

If using the former, the library will need to be configured with a key to decode and verify the token.

The following code block demonstrates using Apollo Server, extracting the `Authorization` header from the request, and putting it into the appropriate context field:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema, // schema from Neo4jGraphQL.getSchema()
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    listen: { port: 4000 },
    context: async ({ req }) => ({
        token: req.headers.Authorization,
    }),
});
----

Optionally, if a custom decoding mechanism is required, that same header can be decoded and the resulting JWT payload put into the `jwt` field of the context.

=== Symmetric secret

To configure the library with a symmetric secret (e.g. "secret"), the following instantiation is required:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    features: {
        authorization: {
            key: "secret",
        },
    },
});
----

=== JWKS endpoint

To configure the library to verify tokens against a JWKS endpoint, "https://www.myapplication.com/.well-known/jwks.json", the following instantiation is required:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    features: {
        authorization: {
            key: {
                url: "https://www.myapplication.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
            },
        },
    },
});
----

== JWT

By default, filtering is available on https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1[the registered claim names] in the JWT specification.

Filtering can be configured for additional JWT claims using the `@jwt` directive and, in some circumstances, the `@jwtClaim` directive.

If you configure an additional `roles` claim, which is an array of strings located at the root of the JWT payload, the following must be added to the type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type JWT @jwt {
    roles: [String!]!
}
----

Note that the type name here, `JWT`, is not required, and this can have any name as long as it is decorated with the `@jwt` directive.

=== Nested claims

If the previous `roles` claim is not located at the JWT payload root, but instead in a nested location, for example:

[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
    "sub": "user1234",
    "myApplication": {
        "roles": ["user", "admin"]
    }
}
----

This needs to be configured using the `@jwtClaim` directive:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type JWT @jwt {
    roles: [String!]! @jwtClaim(path: "myApplication.roles")
}
----

Additionally, if this nested location contains any `.` characters in the path, for example:

[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
    "sub": "user1234",
    "http://www.myapplication.com": {
        "roles": ["user", "admin"]
    }
}
----

These characters need to be escaped:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type JWT @jwt {
    roles: [String!]! @jwtClaim(path: "http://www\\\\.myapplication\\\\.com.roles")
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The seemingly excessive escaping is required to doubly escape: once for GraphQL and once for `dot-prop`, which is used under the hood to resolve the path.

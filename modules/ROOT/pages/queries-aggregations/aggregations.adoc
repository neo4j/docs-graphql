= Aggregations

Based on the given <<queries-aggregations/index.adoc#examples-reference, type definitions>>, here is a list of fields that accept aggregations supported by Neo4j GraphQL:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Type | Aggregating function | Example

| String (e.g. `ID`, `String`)
| `shortest`, `longest`
a| 
.Longest User name
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        name {
            longest
        }
    }
}
----

| Numeric (e.g. `Int`, `Float`, `BigInt`)
| `min`, `max`, `average`, `sum`
a|
.Example query
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        
    }
}
---- 

| Temporal (e.g. `DateTime`, `Time`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `Duration`)
| `min`, `max`
a|
.First Post date
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    postsAggregate {
        createdAt {
            min
        }
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The argument `where` can also be used in aggregation queries for xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc[filtering] data.

== Aggregate related nodes

Related nodes can also be aggregated within a query by accessing the aggregation fields in the node.
In these fields, you can **count**, aggregate the **nodes** or **edges** fields.

The same selections and types as before are available in relationship aggregations.

.Counting User nodes
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        count
    }
}
----

.Counting User nodes where name starts with "J"
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate(where: { name_STARTS_WITH: "J" }) {
        count
    }
}
----

.Counting all posts per User
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate {
            count
        }
    }
}
----

By using the `node` field, related nodes properties can be aggregated:

.Finding longest post per User
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            node {
                content {
                  longest
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== Aggregate relationships

Relationship properties can be aggregated as well by using the `edge` field:

.Querying what User nodes posted up to a date
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            edge {
              date {
                max
              }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

When performing an aggregation on related nodes, the query against the relationship
can be defined as "undirected" by using the argument `directed: false`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate(directed: false) {
            count
        }
    }
}

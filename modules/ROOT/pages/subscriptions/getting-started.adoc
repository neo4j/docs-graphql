= Getting started with subscriptions

This guide shows how to start using subscription capabilities on a GraphQL server.

[NOTE]
====
If you use link:https://studio.apollographql.com/[Apollo Studio], make sure to select the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] implementation in the connection settings.
====


== Enable subscription capabilities

Before using subscriptions on a GraphQL server, you must enable them by passing the `subscriptions` feature to `Neo4jGraphQL`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        subscriptions: true
    },
});
----


== Install dependencies

Then, the next step is to install the following dependencies:

[source, bash]
----
npm i --save ws graphql-ws neo4j-driver @neo4j/graphql express @apollo/server body-parser cors
----


== Setting up an `@apollo/server` server

Add the following code to your `index.js` file to implement a simple `@apollo/server` server with subscriptions (for more options, see link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/[Apollo's documentation]):

[source, javascript, indent=no]
----
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { expressMiddleware } from "@apollo/server/express4";
import { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } from "@apollo/server/plugin/drainHttpServer";
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cors from "cors";
import { createServer } from "http";
import neo4j from 'neo4j-driver';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from '@neo4j/graphql';
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";
import { useServer } from "graphql-ws/lib/use/ws";
import express from 'express';

const typeDefs = `
    type Movie {
        title: String
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password"));

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        subscriptions: true
    },
});

async function main() {
    // Apollo server setup with WebSockets
    const app = express();
    const httpServer = createServer(app);
    const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
        server: httpServer,
        path: "/graphql",
    });

    // Neo4j schema
    const schema = await neoSchema.getSchema();

    const serverCleanup = useServer(
        {
            schema,
            context: (ctx) => {
                return ctx;
            },
        },
        wsServer
    );

    const server = new ApolloServer({
        schema,
        plugins: [
            ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({
                httpServer
            }),
            {
                async serverWillStart() {
                    return Promise.resolve({
                        async drainServer() {
                            await serverCleanup.dispose();
                        },
                    });
                },
            },
        ],
    });
    await server.start();

    app.use(
        "/graphql",
        cors(),
        bodyParser.json(),
        expressMiddleware(server, {
            context: async ({ req }) => ({ req }),
        })
    );

    const PORT = 4000;
    httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}/graphql`);
    });
}

main();

[NOTE]
====
This setup uses the default subscriptions mechanism suitable only for development, testing, and single instance servers. 
If you need to scale horizontally for a production-ready application, see xref::subscriptions/scaling.adoc[Horizontal scaling].
====

== GraphQL subscriptions

With the previous server running, the available subscriptions are set for `Movie` and `Actor`. 
You can subscribe to new movies created with the following statement:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
subscription {
    movieCreated(where: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        createdMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
----

With that, any new movie created with the matching title will trigger a subscription. 
You can try this with the following query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createMovies(input: [{ title: "The Matrix" }]) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
----

:description: This page describes how to delete nodes using mutations.


= `delete`

Using these type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

These `delete` mutations and response types should be generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type DeleteInfo {
    nodesDeleted: Int!
    relationshipsDeleted: Int!
}

type Mutation {
    deletePosts(where: PostWhere, delete: PostDeleteInput): DeleteInfo!
    deleteUsers(where: UserWhere, delete: UserDeleteInput): DeleteInfo!
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The `DeleteInfo` type is the common return type for all delete mutations.
====

== Single `delete`

A single post can be deleted by executing the following GraphQL statement:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    deletePosts(where: {
        id: "6042E807-47AE-4857-B7FE-1AADF522DE8B"
    }) {
        nodesDeleted
        relationshipsDeleted
    }
}
----

This should delete the post using the autogenerated ID that was returned after that post's creation.
Consequently, `nodesDeleted` should be equal `1` (the post) and `relationshipsDeleted` should also equal `1` as the `HAS_POST` relationship between the `Post` and its author was deleted.

== Nested `delete`

In case you want to delete a `User` *and* all of their posts, you can use a single nested `delete` mutation:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  deleteUsers(where: { name: "Jane Doe" }, delete: { posts: {} }) {
    nodesDeleted
    relationshipsDeleted
  }
}
----

By the time the traversal has reached it, that empty `where` argument has the context of only refer to posts that were created by Jane Doe, as the traversals to those `Post` nodes were from her `User` node. 
Essentially, the above query is equivalent to:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    deleteUsers(
        where: {
            name: "Jane Doe"
        },
        delete: {
            posts: [
                where: {
                    node: {
                        creator: {
                            name: "Jane Doe"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ) {
        nodesDeleted
        relationshipsDeleted
    }
}
----

Note that the output Cypher statement should also have a redundant `WHERE` clause:

//Please add the cypher statement:

//[source, cypher, indent=0]
//----
//DELETE User (name:"Jane Doe") 
//WHERE Posts -
//----

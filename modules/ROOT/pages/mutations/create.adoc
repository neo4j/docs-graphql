:description: This page describes how to create nodes through mutations.
= `create`

Using the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

These `create` mutations and response types should be generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type CreatePostsMutationResponse {
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type CreateUsersMutationResponse {
    users: [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
    createPosts(input: [PostCreateInput!]!): CreatePostsMutationResponse!
    createUsers(input: [UsersCreateInput!]!): CreateUsersMutationResponse!
}
----

Note that the `CreateInput` types closely mirror the object type definitions.
This allows you to create not only the type in question, but to recurse down and perform further operations on related types in the same mutation.

[NOTE]
====
The `id` field is absent from both `create` input types as the xref::/directives/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`] directive has been used.
====

== Single `create`

A single `User` can be created by executing the following GraphQL statement:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createUsers(input: [
        {
            name: "John Doe"
        }
    ]) {
        users {
            id
            name
        }
    }
}
----

This should create a `User` with name "John Doe", and that name plus the autogenerated ID should be returned.

== Nested `create`

A `User` and an initial `Post` can be created by executing the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createUsers(input: [
        {
            name: "John Doe"
            posts: {
                create: [
                    {
                        node: {
                            content: "Hi, my name is John!"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]) {
        users {
            id
            name
            posts {
                id
                content
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This creates a `User` with name "John Doe" and an introductory post.
Both should be returned with their autogenerated IDs.

[NOTE]
====
You can perform similar and complementary actions by using the `update` mutation combined with `create`.
Read about xref:mutations/update.adoc#_connectorcreate_relationships[`update`] for more information.
====

== `connectOrCreate` relationships

If a related node has a `@unique` or `@id` directive defined, `connectOrCreate` can be used in a nested `create` to perform a `MERGE` operation on the related node.
This should create a new relationship and the related node if it doesn't exist yet.

Consider the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
    name: String!
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}

type Movie {
    title: String
    id: ID! @id
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}
----

Because a movie ID is unique, `connectOrCreate` can be used in an `Actor` mutation to ensure the movie exists in the database before connecting. 
Note that only `@unique` or `@id` fields can be used in `where`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  createActors(input: {
    name: "Tom Hanks",
    movies: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: { node: { id: "1234" } }
        onCreate: { node: { title: "Forrest Gump" } }
      }
    }
  }) {
    info {
      nodesCreated
    }
  }
}
----

This will ensure that a movie with ID 1234 exists and it is connected to `"Tom Hanks"`. If the movie does not exist, it will be created with the title `"Forrest Gump"`. Note that if the movie with the given ID already exists, it will be connected to it, regardless of the title.

== `CREATE` optimization

With the `create` operations, there is no limit on how many nodes can be created at once.
However, there is a known performance issue for large batch sizes. 

The Neo4j GraphQL Library contains an optimization feature designed to mitigate it, but it does not work in the following scenarios:

* A field is populated using the directive `@populated_by`.
* The `connect` or `connectOrCreate` operation is used.
* Interface and union types are present in the mutation.

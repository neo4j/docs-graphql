[[populated-by-directive]]
== `@populatedBy`

The `@populatedBy` directive is used to specify a callback function that gets executed during GraphQL query parsing,
to populate fields which have not been provided within the input.

The `@private` directive protects fields which should only be available through the xref::ogm/index.adoc[OGM].

Reference: xref::ogm/private.adoc[`@private` Directive]

== `@query`

Reference: xref:reference/directives/schema-configuration/type-configuration.adoc#_query[`@query`]

== `@queryOptions`

Reference: xref::reference/directives/default-values.adoc#type-definitions-default-values-queryoptions[`@queryOptions`]

== `@relationship`

The `@relationship` directive is used to configure relationships between object types.

Reference: xref::reference/type-definitions/relationships.adoc[Relationships], xref::reference/directives/schema-configuration/field-configuration.adoc#_relationship[`@relationship`]

== `@relationshipProperties`

Required to help you distinguish between interfaces which are used for relationship properties, and otherwise.

Can only be used on interfaces, as per its definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Required to differentiate between interfaces for relationship properties, and otherwise."""
directive @relationshipProperties on INTERFACE
----

== `@selectable`

Reference: xref:reference/directives/schema-configuration/field-configuration.adoc#_selectable[`@selectable`]

== `@settable`

Reference: xref:reference/directives/schema-configuration/field-configuration.adoc#_settable[`@settable`]

Reference: xref:reference/directives/schema-configuration/type-configuration.adoc#_subscription[`@subscription`]

== `@timestamp`

The `@timestamp` directive flags fields to be used to store timestamps on create/update events.

Reference: xref::reference/directives/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-timestamp[`@timestamp`]

== `@unique`

The `@unique` directive indicates that there should be a uniqueness constraint in the database for the fields that it is applied to.

= Authentication
:description: This page describes how to set up authentication features in the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

== `@authentication`

The GraphQL Library offers the `@authentication` directive to configure authentication for certain operations and for different parts of your schema.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Explicit authentication, configured with the `@authentication` directive, is only evaluated during Cypher translation time.
Unauthenticated requests with queries requiring authentication never reach the database.

=== Usage

== Operations

Authentication can be configured to only be validated on certain operations:

* `CREATE`
* `READ`
* `AGGREGATE`
* `UPDATE`
* `DELETE`
* `CREATE_RELATIONSHIP`
* `DELETE_RELATIONSHIP`
* `SUBSCRIBE`

For instance, to only require authentication for the update or deletion of a user:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @authentication(operations: [UPDATE, DELETE]) {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    password: String!
}
----

[NOTE]
====
In case there is no `operations` argument with a list of operations, the GraphQL Library treats the authentication configuration as if the full list of operations had been provided.
====

== Scope

=== Global authentication

Authentication can be applied to the entire schema.
This ensures authentication is checked for every matching request.

Extend the schema:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
extend schema @authentication
----

The `operations` and `jwt` arguments can also be used when the directive is applied to a schema extension, for example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
extend schema @authentication(operations: [UPDATE, DELETE], jwt: { roles_INCLUDES: "admin" })
----

=== Authentication for types

Authentication can be configured for an entire type:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @authentication {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    password: String!
}
----

With this configuration, authentication is validated when any of the following operations are _attempted_:

* *Create*: `createUsers` mutation, `create`, or `connectOrCreate` nested operation via a related type.
* *Read*: `users`, `usersConnection`, `usersAggregate` query, or access via related type.
* *Update*: `updateUsers` mutation or `update` nested operation via a related type.
* *Delete*: `deleteUsers` mutation or `delete` nested operation via a related type.
* *Create relationship*: `connect` or `connectOrCreate` nested operation via a related type.
* *Delete relationship*: `disconnect` nested operation via a related type.
* *Subscribe*: all subscription operations related to type `User`.


=== Authentication for fields

Authentication can be configured on a per-field basis, for example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    password: String! @authentication
}
----

This is only evaluated under the following circumstances:

* The `password` field is set on either `create` or `update`.
* The `password` field is present in a selection set.


== Additional verification

Additional checks against JWT claims can be performed together with authentication. 
For instance, if it was a requirement that only users with the `admin` role can delete users:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @authentication(operations: [DELETE], jwt: { roles_INCLUDES: "admin" }) {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    password: String!
}
----
